# CliqueToSATEncoder
This is a Python script I built for reducing the well-known NP-complete Clique problem to the perhaps even more well-known Boolean Satisfiability Problem, such that the output (a DIMACS-formatted CNF formula) can be passed to a SAT solver, a type of software whose development began in the 1990s and whose efficiency continues to improve today, decades later.
